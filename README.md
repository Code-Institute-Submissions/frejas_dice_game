# Welcome to Freja's Dice Game #

This project was made for the a project for Code Institue Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project.
The aim was to make a fun game in Javascript and completing the recommanded task.

This game is aimed at younger children with the intent that the whole family could play. Fraja's Dice Game is a simple dice game where a player rolls a die and the second player after seeing the resault from the first player, than can choose any dice to compete against. But the players can only use a dice once per round. So the game is about insuring enough points and using the right dice at that time.

When I first played the game, I noticed that the child who taught me, had troubles on choosing which dice to use. In this project, I added a help options which changes the border of the dice and show the percentage of the dice to win. This allowed me to show case more skill in Frontend Development.



## UX ##
This project while aimed at completing a milestone project, it is made for family's so as such I wanted I friendly atmosphere!

### As a Player ### 

* I wanted a fun game for the family or to play against the computer.
    * Rewarding game that insureance the player **wants** to come back and try again.
* A beautiful back drop with intuition gameplay for all ages.
    * The theme of the game is bright and pleaseing to look at while the actucal game play stands out. While there are lots of buttons on screen, the game insurances that the player can only use their buttons while there turn. 
* Large buttons and ease of play.
    * A clear understand on whos player board is which player. 
    * Highlights whos turn it is.
* Help function to understand the probability on which dice is the better option.
    * The game is based on a stragy on which dice to use on which time. The help function enables the player to make better choices.
    * For children: A simple boarder change of the dices allows to see which dice are better.
    For Adults: The probabily for each dice choice is shown
    -side note: Adults want to work out the probablity and check against the app.

### As the programmer ### 
As the programmer, I wanted to show case a wide variaty of skills I have learnt through Interactive Frontend Development.

* Taking new inputs and appling throught out the DOM manipulation.
* Control of random function and applying functions to an Array.
* Using DRY apporach and reusing function to many asspects through out the game.
* Applying mouse over and click functions for DOM manipulation, applying functions when needed.
* Show case 'for loops' , 'if functions' and 'case functions' as well as creating a unqice function for a percentage function.


## Features ##
As this is for a 'Milestone Project' I wanted to show case a variaty of new skills and apply them in different sceros.

- Taking input and applying them throughtout the project:
    By taking new input from the player and changing DOM to show player play areas and show who is who.
    
    -Case: What happens if a player leaves their name blank?
    If a player leaves their name blank, a predetermanined 'Player 1' or 'Player 2' name will be the default. 

    -Demonstrates: This shows the programmer has the skills of manipulating DOM by adding innerHtml though javascript and Jquery, correct id and class names though HTML and CSS.  

- Applying a 'Help' option
    This project is based on a game of chance and which situation should you play which dice. 
    Borders of the dice change on their percentage on winning and infomation of the probablity is displayed.
    Case function and for loops were used in combination to achieve this.
    
    -case: If player one rolled a d8 and has a score of 4. Player 2 dice's boarders change to show which dice can beat that score and what probablity it has to win.

    -Demonstrates: By using 'this' values and giving it a variable name. Allows the programmer to pass it though multiply functions to give percentages and scores. While 'this' value can change instantly, the functions will adapt and different results can be observed though out the game play.




## Future Implement ##
- A simple AI to play against
    With the use of 'random' functions, a simple computer player was applied to the project so that the game could be played as a 1 player game.
    
    - case: While the computers first go, can be completely random. The computers second go against a player needed to be more complex. While using a probality function, the computer could play a dice to actually compete to the players value. But if the computer options were not satisfatory, using of a low value dice would have a stagic gameplay.

- Change the diffulty of the computer.
    - Enable an easy, medium or hard mode by changing the computers probabily choice.

- Add more dice.
    - Adding more options for the dice.
   
## Technologies Used ##    
- HTML and css: Building the base of the visual game and changing style of indivual site taste.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootwatch](https://bootswatch.com/): Allowing ease use of row and columes to allow the game to feel more structured.

- Javascript and [Jquery](https://jquery.com/): Applying functions and DOM manipulation.

- [Github](https://github.com/): Saving and deploying the site .

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/): To write the program

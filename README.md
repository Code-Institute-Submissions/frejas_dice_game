<h2>Welcome to Freja's Dice Game</h2>

This project was made for the a project for Code Institue Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project.
The aim was to make a fun game in Javascript and completing the recommanded task.

This game is aimed at younger children with the intent that the whole family could play. Fraja's Dice Game is a simple dice game where a player rolls a die and the second player after seeing the resault from the first player, than can choose any dice to compete against. But the players can only use a dice once per round. So the game is about insuring enough points and using the right dice at that time.

When I first played the game, I noticed that the child who taught me, had troubles on choosing which dice to use. In this project, I added a help options which changes the border of the dice and show the percentage of the dice to win. The project also has a simple computer element so that the game could be played as a one person game.
